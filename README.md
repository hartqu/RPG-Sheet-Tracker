# RPG-Sheet-Tracker
A simple interface that can record a character’s statistics, abilities and inventory. Written in Godot.

‘Dungeons and Dragons’ style role playing games are fun and engage the imagination. They also
require users to keep track of a constantly changing series of statistics, items and points. It would be
helpful if there was a simple interface that could record a character’s statistics, abilities and
inventory. It would also be helpful if this could be updated easily as the game progresses.

## Features
There may be several characters. Each character has the following statistics:
* Health
* Strength
* Agility
* Intelligence
* Up to three special abilities
* Up to five items in inventory
* One item in hand
* Gold

You can:
* Set each character a class and a name
* Set statistics and items
* Update statistics and items
* Show all details, statistics and items for the characters
